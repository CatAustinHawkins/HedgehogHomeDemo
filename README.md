---------------------------------------------------------------------

In the summer of 2022 I worked on the demo for Hedgehog Home, and released it for browser on the 18th of September 2022. 

The Demo contains:

Health, Hunger and Fun meters

Night and Day time modes



Night Time:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Feed Option - player can feed their hedgehog using a variety of food. Cost of food scaled with the hunger it restores

Play Option - player can play with their hedgehog to restore fun meter. Two mini-games available:

Worm Hunt - player can run around collecting coins, worms that restore their hunger and can get damaged by poisoned slugs.

Leafpile Rummage - player can use 1 gold to get a random item to decorate their garden with.

Vet Option - player can restore the health, hunger and fun bars of the hedgehog, for gold. 



Daytime: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Work Option

Question Time - player answers a series of true or false questions about hedgehogs. For example "Hedgehogs are Rodents" - inwhich the player is meant to answer that this is false. Answering correctly gives the player 2 gold.

Decorate Option - The player can use the items they won from Leafpile Rummage to decorate their garden.

If the hedgehogs fun or hunger reaches 0, their health bar slowly goes down. If their health bar reaches 0 the hedgehog runs away and the game is over.
